# Detect-and-Remove-Consecutive-Duplicates-in-a-String
Write a Java program that takes a string as input and removes consecutive duplicate characters.
Explanation:
The function loops through the string.

It compares each character with the previous one.

If itâ€™s different, it appends it to the result.

This efficiently removes only consecutive duplicates (not all duplicates)....
